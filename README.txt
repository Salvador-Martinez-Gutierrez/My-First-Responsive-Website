## Description

Welcome to my first Website for "La Akademia". A Landing Page built using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Java Script.

The 2 main goals of this educational project were:

1. To practice Flex-Box, responsive design and DOM manipulation.

2. To create a Landing Page Funnel Free courses about Web3 and AI.

Several improvement can be made. Here I highlight a few:

1. Adding semantic HTML and improving accesibility.

2. Cleaning up the CSS file, eliminating innecesary lines. 

3. Adding a pop-up with a form for users to leave their contact info after clicking on any of the courses.
